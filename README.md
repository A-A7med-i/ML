# Machine Learning

This repository contains resources and projects related to machine learning.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. In other words, ML allows computers to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

The core idea behind machine learning is to create models that can automatically learn patterns from data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data.
   - The model is trained on a dataset where the correct output is provided for each input.
   - Examples include:
     - Classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition)
     - Regression (e.g., price prediction, weather forecasting)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data.
   - The algorithm tries to find patterns or structures in the data without predefined labels.
   - Examples include:
     - Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection)
     - Dimensionality reduction (e.g., feature extraction, visualization)

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
   - The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.
   - Examples include:
     - Game playing (e.g., chess, Go)
     - Robotics (e.g., autonomous vehicles, robot navigation)
